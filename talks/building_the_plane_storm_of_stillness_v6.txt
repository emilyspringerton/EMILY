🎤 Building the Plane Through the Storm of Stillness
Why Real Progress Feels Calm—and Like Being Lost

Most of us are taught that progress should feel exciting.

That growth should feel fast.

That success should come with urgency, energy, and constant motion.

We celebrate hustle.
We celebrate being busy.
We celebrate chaos.

And every day, we wake up with the same quiet hope:

That the world will make more sense at the end of the day than it did at the beginning.

That boxes will be checked.
Problems will be solved.
Things will move forward.

We think, “Today I’ll crush that bug.”
“Today we’ll finally move this project ahead.”
“Today everything will click.”

But after working inside organizations of every size—from two-person startups to Fortune 25 companies—I’ve learned something surprising.

The biggest breakthroughs don’t feel loud.

They feel quiet.

And if we’re honest, most days end feeling more chaotic than they started.

The more we grind, the farther the finish line feels.
The harder we push, the more lost we feel.

I’ve spent my career building and shipping things in wildly different environments.

Tiny startups where everyone did everything.
Mid-sized companies scaling fast.
Massive enterprises where a single decision moves millions of dollars.

Different cultures.
Different resources.
Different stakes.

But the same human pattern showed up everywhere.

Whether it was a small product launch…
A major digital transformation…
A new initiative…
A strategy pivot…
Or a company-wide process overhaul…

Every time real progress started happening, something strange occurred.

The chaos slowed.

The fires stopped.

The adrenaline dropped.

Everything got calm.

And instead of relief—

people got uncomfortable.

I heard the same phrases everywhere:

“Things feel stagnant.”
“We need to shake things up.”
“Let’s pivot.”
“Let’s restructure.”
“Let’s move faster.”

Even when results were improving.

At first, I thought this was impatience.

But the more I watched, the clearer it became.

We weren’t responding to performance.

We were responding to how progress felt.

In chaos, everything feels urgent.

Meetings are constant.
Decisions happen fast.
People are reacting all day.

It feels like productivity.

But often—

it’s just motion.

Then, when systems stabilize…
When workflows improve…
When projects finally start running smoothly…

The environment gets quieter.

Fewer emergencies.
Fewer late nights.
Fewer constant pivots.

And that calm triggers anxiety.

Not because something’s wrong.

But because calm feels unfamiliar.

Now here’s the part we don’t say out loud:

When the chaos fades, it doesn’t suddenly feel good.

It often feels like being lost.

Like standing still while the ground quietly rearranges itself underneath you.

Most of us expect progress to feel like clarity.

But real progress feels more like vertigo.

That moment when you close your eyes and really sit with the idea of falling forever.

Not panic.

Not impact.

Just… falling.

No landmarks.
No finish line.
No clear sense of direction.

Just motion without noise.

We assume that feeling means something is broken.

But it often means something is working.

I didn’t fully understand this until I experienced it personally—not just in business, but in creation.

Over the past few years, I built multiple indie games.

An FPS shooter.
A Smash-style brawler.
An ecosystem strategy game.

Totally different genres.

Same lesson.

Early development felt incredible.

New mechanics.
New ideas.
Constant change.

Chaotic.
Exciting.

But every time a game started coming together—

When systems stabilized…
When bugs dropped…
When performance smoothed out…
When it was actually getting closer to being finished…

That’s when the excitement disappeared.

Discomfort took over.

My brain would say:

“This feels boring.”
“Something’s wrong.”
“Let’s start something new.”

And more than once—

I did.

I wasn’t chasing creativity.

I was avoiding the quiet.

That’s when I realized something important.

This isn’t a productivity issue.

It’s a nervous system issue.

When you live in high-pressure environments long enough—startups, corporations, or life itself—stress becomes normal.

Urgency feels safe.

Constant motion feels like progress.

But calm?

Calm feels wrong.

So when real growth begins—steady, sustainable progress—our bodies push us to disrupt it.

Not logically.

Subconsciously.

That’s why projects get abandoned right before they succeed.
Transformations pivot just as they start working.
Strategies change when stability finally appears.
Teams overhaul systems that were finally improving.

We mistake stillness for stagnation.

And confusion for failure.

When often—

it’s the inflection point.

We’ve been trained to chase what I call the dopamine dragon of completion.

Tasks finished.
Bugs closed.
Features shipped.
That hit of “Done.”

But real work—especially meaningful work—almost never feels like clean completion.

It feels messy.
It feels confusing.
It feels like pulling one thread and unraveling five more.

At a startup I worked at, we used to joke about deliverables.

We’d ask, “Is it done?”
Then, “Is it done done?”
Then, “Is it done done done?”
(Laughter)

Because nothing is ever really done.

There’s always another edge case.
Another improvement.
Another integration.
Another deeper problem revealed by solving the last one.

For a long time, that drove me crazy.

I thought progress should feel cleaner.
More linear.
More satisfying.

But eventually I understood:

The feeling of being lost is the cost of making something real.

When systems get simpler, our understanding gets more complex.
When problems get solved, deeper problems appear.
When products mature, nuance explodes.

Progress doesn’t feel like clarity.

It feels like entering bigger rooms of complexity.

And that’s why the stillness feels so unsettling.

Because when chaos fades, we’re left face-to-face with uncertainty.

With not knowing.

With the absence of adrenaline to distract us.

And our brains scream: “This must be wrong.”

So we chase urgency.
We chase closure.
We chase noise.

And that’s how teams burn out.
That’s how projects thrash.
That’s how organizations lose momentum right when it becomes real.

The escape hatch isn’t more urgency.

It’s process orientation.

The most effective teams I’ve seen weren’t obsessed with being done.

They were obsessed with showing up.

Every day.
Calmly.
Consistently.

They asked:

Are we learning?
Are we improving?
Are systems slightly better today than yesterday?

Not: “Is it finished yet?”

Because finished is a myth.

Growth is continuous.

In game development, this finally clicked for me.

When I asked, “Is this done yet?” I felt overwhelmed and behind.

When I asked, “Did I improve something today?” everything changed.

Some days it was one tiny bug.
Some days a 2% system improvement.
Some days just understanding the problem more clearly.

No dramatic moments.

But slowly—

the thing became real.

That’s when I understood:

Progress feels like being lost because you’re exploring territory you’ve never been in before.

Feeling lost isn’t a signal to stop.

It’s a signal you’re in the growth zone.

The stillness isn’t the enemy.
The confusion isn’t failure.
The endless “not quite done” isn’t a problem.

It’s the work.

There’s an old saying:

The seed doesn’t know the shape of the tree.

Growth happens quietly at first.

Underground.

Before anything visible appears.

Breakthroughs don’t announce themselves.

They don’t feel dramatic.

They feel calm.
They feel focused.
They feel consistent.
They feel almost boring.

But that “boring” phase?

That’s where systems stabilize.
That’s where momentum becomes real.
That’s where results compound.

So if you’re leading a project, a team, or a transformation right now—

And things feel quieter than they used to…
Less frantic.
Less reactive.
More stable.

And that calm makes you uneasy—

Or if the more you learn, the more complex the work feels, and the finish line seems to move instead of getting closer—

Take that as information.

Not as a warning.

This is often what real progress feels like.

When systems begin to work, noise fades.
When momentum becomes real, urgency drops.
When growth becomes sustainable, it stops shouting for attention.

The work doesn’t disappear.

It deepens.

So stay present.

Trust the process.

Keep making small, real improvements.

If progress feels calm…
If clarity feels farther away…
If you feel that strange sensation of falling—

Take a breath.

You’re not failing.

You’re not stuck.

You’re in the part where growth becomes real.

That stillness?

That vertigo?

That’s the signal.

That’s the work.

That’s the breakthrough forming.

Thank you.

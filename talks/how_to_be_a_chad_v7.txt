🎤 How to Be a Chad
(A Talk About Progress, Calm, and Not Losing Your Mind)

Everyone tells you progress should feel insane.

Like you should be stressed.
Busy.
Booked.
Slightly panicking at all times.

If you’re not exhausted, you’re “not trying hard enough.”
If you’re not overwhelmed, you’re “falling behind.”
If things feel calm, something must be wrong.

We worship hustle.
We worship chaos.
We worship being on.

But here’s the plot twist no one warns you about:

Real progress doesn’t feel hype.

It feels… quiet.

And honestly?
That freaks people out.

I’ve worked in startups, mid-size companies, and huge corporations where one decision moves millions of dollars.

Different vibes.
Different stakes.
Same behavior.

Whenever something actually started working—

The chaos slowed.
The fires stopped.
The adrenaline dropped.

And instead of celebrating?

People panicked.

Suddenly it was:

“Wait, why does this feel slow?”
“We should pivot.”
“Let’s shake things up.”
“We’re getting stagnant.”

Even when results were clearly improving.

At first I thought people were just impatient.

But no.

They weren’t reacting to outcomes.

They were reacting to the feeling.

Because chaos feels productive.

Meetings nonstop.
Messages flying.
Everyone stressed.

It looks like progress.

But half the time it’s just motion.
Like running on a treadmill and calling it a journey.

Then something dangerous happens.

Systems stabilize.
Workflows click.
Things stop breaking every five minutes.

And suddenly it’s… quiet.

No emergencies.
No fire drills.
No dopamine hits.

And your brain goes:

🚨 “THIS IS WRONG.” 🚨

Not because it is.

But because calm feels unfamiliar.

Here’s the part nobody says out loud:

When chaos disappears, progress doesn’t feel good.

It feels like being lost.

Like that moment when you close your eyes and think too hard about infinity and your stomach drops.

No clear direction.
No dramatic wins.
No obvious finish line.

Just… steady forward motion.

Which is terrifying if you’re addicted to urgency.

I didn’t understand this until I hit it myself.

I’ve built multiple indie games—totally different genres.

Early development?
Elite vibes.

New mechanics.
New ideas.
Everything changing constantly.

Pure chaos.
Pure dopamine.

But every time a game started coming together—

When systems stabilized.
When bugs dropped.
When performance smoothed out.

The excitement vanished.

And my brain said:

“This is boring.”
“Something’s off.”
“Start a new project.”

And sometimes?

I listened.

I thought I was chasing creativity.

I was actually avoiding the quiet.

That’s when it clicked:

This isn’t a productivity problem.

It’s a nervous system problem.

If you grow up in high-pressure environments long enough, stress feels normal.

Urgency feels safe.

Calm feels fake.

So when real growth starts—slow, stable, sustainable growth—your body tries to sabotage it.

Not consciously.

Automatically.

That’s why people quit right before things work.
Why projects get scrapped right before payoff.
Why teams self-destruct once momentum becomes real.

We confuse stillness with stagnation.

When often?

It’s the exact opposite.

Here’s another hard truth:

Progress does not feel like clarity.

It feels like entering bigger rooms of complexity.

Every problem you solve unlocks three deeper ones.

Every system you simplify reveals nuance you couldn’t see before.

That’s not failure.

That’s reality.

Being “lost” isn’t a signal to stop.

It’s the admission price for making something real.

And here’s where the title finally makes sense:

A Chad is not loud.

A Chad is not frantic.

A Chad is not constantly proving they’re busy.

A Chad shows up calmly.
Improves small things consistently.
Doesn’t need chaos to feel important.

Chad energy is process over panic.

The most effective people and teams I’ve seen weren’t obsessed with being done.

They were obsessed with showing up.

Every day.

They asked:

Did we learn something?
Did we improve something?
Is this slightly better than yesterday?

Not:

“Is it finished yet?”

Because “finished” is fake.

Growth is continuous.

When I stopped asking “Is this done yet?”
and started asking “Did I improve something today?”

Everything changed.

Some days it was one tiny bug.
Some days a 2% improvement.
Some days just understanding the problem better.

No hype moments.

But suddenly—

the thing worked.

So here’s the actual Chad advice:

If things feel calm…
If progress feels quiet…
If you feel slightly lost instead of stressed…

Don’t panic.

Don’t self-sabotage.
Don’t manufacture urgency.
Don’t blow things up just to feel alive.

That calm?

That’s momentum.

That weird falling feeling?

That’s growth without noise.

You’re not behind.

You’re not failing.

You’re in the part where things stop shouting and start compounding.

That’s Chad territory.

Thank you. 😌🗿

🎤 Building the Plane Through the Storm of Stillness
Why Real Progress Feels Calm—and Like Being Lost

Most of us are taught that progress should feel exciting.

That growth should feel fast.

That success should come with urgency, energy, and constant motion.

We celebrate hustle.
We celebrate being busy.
We celebrate chaos.

And every day, we wake up with a quiet hope:

That the world will make more sense at the end of the day than it did at the beginning.

We want that feeling of boxes checked.
Problems solved.
Things moving forward.

We think, “Today I’ll crush that bug.”
“Today we’ll move this project ahead.”
“Today everything will finally click.”

But after working inside organizations of every size—from two-person startups to Fortune 25 companies—I’ve learned something surprising.

The biggest breakthroughs don’t feel loud.

They feel quiet.

And if we’re honest, most days end feeling more chaotic than they started.

The more we grind, the farther the finish line feels.
The harder we push, the more lost we feel.

I’ve spent my career building and shipping things in wildly different environments.

Tiny startups where everyone did everything.
Mid-sized companies scaling fast.
Massive enterprises where a single decision moves millions of dollars.

Different cultures.
Different resources.
Different stakes.

But the same human pattern showed up everywhere.

Whether it was a small product launch…
A major digital transformation…
A new initiative…
A strategy pivot…
Or a company-wide process overhaul…

Every time real progress started happening, something strange occurred.

The chaos slowed.

The fires stopped.

The adrenaline dropped.

Everything got calm.

And instead of relief—

people got uncomfortable.

I heard the same phrases in every environment:

“Things feel stagnant.”
“We need to shake things up.”
“Let’s pivot.”
“Let’s restructure.”
“Let’s move faster.”

Even when results were improving.

At first, I thought this was just impatience.

But the more I watched, the clearer it became.

We weren’t responding to performance.

We were responding to how progress felt.

In chaos, everything feels urgent.

Meetings are constant.
Decisions happen fast.
People are reacting all day.

It feels like productivity.

But often—

it’s just motion.

Then, when systems stabilize…
When workflows improve…
When projects finally start running smoothly…

The environment gets quieter.

Fewer emergencies.
Fewer late nights.
Fewer constant pivots.

And that calm triggers anxiety.

Not because something’s wrong.

But because calm feels unfamiliar.

We assume that stillness—
or that sudden feeling of being lost—

means failure.

But here’s the truth:

It’s often progress.

We’ve been trained to chase what I call the dopamine dragon of completion.

We want tasks finished.
Bugs closed.
Features shipped.
That hit of “Done.”

But real work—especially meaningful work—almost never feels clean.

It feels messy.
It feels confusing.
It feels like pulling on one thread and accidentally unraveling five more.

At one startup I worked at, we used to joke about deliverables.

We’d ask, “Is it done?”
Someone would say, “It’s done.”
Then, “Is it done done?”
Then, “Is it done done done?”
(Laughter)

Because nothing is ever really done done done.

There’s always another edge case.
Another improvement.
Another integration.
Another problem revealed by solving the last one.

For a long time, that drove me crazy.

I thought progress should feel cleaner.
More linear.
More satisfying.

But eventually, I realized something important:

The feeling of being lost is the cost of making something real.

When systems get simpler, our understanding gets more complex.
When problems get solved, deeper problems appear.
When products mature, nuance explodes.

Progress doesn’t feel like clarity.

It feels like entering bigger rooms of complexity.

And that’s why the stillness feels so uncomfortable.

Because when chaos fades, we’re left face-to-face with uncertainty.

With not knowing.

And our brains scream, “This must be wrong.”

I didn’t fully understand this until I experienced it personally—not just in business, but in creation.

Over the past few years, I built multiple indie games.

An FPS shooter.
A Smash-style brawler.
An ecosystem strategy game.

Totally different genres.

Same lesson.

Early development always felt incredible.

New mechanics.
New ideas.
Constant change.

Chaotic.
Exciting.

But every time a game started coming together—

When systems stabilized…
When bugs dropped…
When performance smoothed out…
When it was actually getting close to being finished…

That’s when the excitement disappeared.

Discomfort took over.

My brain would say:

“This feels boring.”
“Something’s wrong.”
“Let’s start something new.”

And more than once—

I did.

I wasn’t chasing creativity.

I was avoiding the quiet.

Everything changed when I stopped asking, “Is this done yet?”
And started asking, “Did I improve something today?”

Some days, I fixed one tiny bug.
Some days, I improved one system by 2%.
Some days, I just learned something new.

No dramatic moments.

But slowly—

everything started working.

That’s when I realized:

This isn’t a productivity issue.

It’s a nervous system issue.

When you operate in high-pressure environments long enough—startups, corporations, or life itself—stress becomes normal.

Urgency feels safe.

Constant motion feels like progress.

But calm?

Calm feels wrong.

So when real growth begins—steady, sustainable progress—our bodies push us to disrupt it.

Not logically.

Subconsciously.

That’s why projects get abandoned right before they succeed.
Transformations pivot just as they start working.
Strategies change when stability finally appears.
Teams overhaul systems that were finally improving.

We mistake stillness for stagnation.

And confusion for failure.

When often—

it’s the inflection point.

Even preparing this talk, I felt it.

When I first finished writing it, it felt powerful.

Clear.

True.

And then minutes later, my mind said:

“This is too simple.”
“This feels obvious.”
“Maybe it needs more excitement.”

That urge to complicate it—
to change it—
to abandon it—

was the same instinct I’d watched derail projects for years.

The pattern is primal.

It shows up in startups.
In Fortune 25 companies.
In creative work.
In personal growth.

There’s an old saying:

The seed doesn’t know the shape of the tree.

Growth happens quietly at first.

Underground.

Before anything visible appears.

Breakthroughs don’t announce themselves.

They don’t feel dramatic.

They feel calm.
They feel focused.
They feel consistent.
They feel almost boring.

But that “boring” phase?

That’s where systems stabilize.
That’s where momentum becomes real.
That’s where results compound.

Feeling lost isn’t a signal to stop.

It’s a signal you’re exploring new territory.

The escape hatch isn’t more urgency.

It’s process orientation.

The most effective teams I’ve seen weren’t obsessed with being done.

They were obsessed with showing up to the process—
consistently, calmly.

They asked:

Are we learning?
Are we improving?
Are systems slightly better today than yesterday?

Not, “Is it finished yet?”

Because finished is a myth.

Growth is continuous.

The stillness isn’t the enemy.
The confusion isn’t failure.
The endless “not quite done” isn’t a problem.

It’s the process.

And when you embrace that, something powerful happens.

You stop needing chaos to feel productive.
You stop chasing dopamine.
You stop thrashing between strategies.
You stop burning out your teams.

You lean into the calm.

You lean into the uncertainty.

You lean into the feeling of being a little lost.

Because that’s where real work lives.

So if you’re leading a project, a team, or a transformation right now—

And things feel quieter than they used to…
Less frantic.
Less reactive.
More stable.

And that calm makes you uneasy—

Or if the more you learn, the more complex the work feels, and the finish line seems to move instead of getting closer—

Take that as information.

Not as a warning.

This is often what real progress feels like.

When systems begin to work, noise fades.
When momentum becomes real, urgency drops.
When growth becomes sustainable, it stops shouting for attention.

The work doesn’t disappear.
It deepens.

So remain calm.

Stay present with the process.
Keep making small, real improvements.
Keep learning.
Keep refining.

You don’t need to manufacture urgency.
You don’t need to shake things up.
You don’t need to chase chaos to prove something is happening.

If things feel steady, focused, and quietly demanding—

That’s not stagnation.

That’s momentum.

We are always building the plane as we fly it.
But when the flight smooths out, that’s not the moment to grab the controls in panic.

It’s the moment to trust what you’ve built.

So if you feel a little lost…
If clarity feels farther away than when you started…
If progress feels calm instead of chaotic—

Take a breath.

You’re not failing.
You’re not stuck.

You’re in the part where growth becomes real.

That stillness?

That’s the signal.

That’s the work.

That’s the breakthrough forming.

Thank you.

- perf(goldenbuild): per-source SHA-256 content cache (context/golden-cache.json) — only changed sources trigger haiku recompression; saves ~14 haiku calls/rebuild (~63K haiku tokens/day at 5 rebuilds/day)
- perf(rsi): cap iteration history in buildGenerationPrompt to last 3 iterations — prevents prompt bloat on long tasks (~150 tokens saved per omitted iteration record)

## 2026-06-12
- feat(goldenbuild): GoldenDocCompiler — compresses Tier 1 golden docs from all repos into context/full-system-context.md via haiku bilingual compression; MaybeRebuild wired into RunOnce; dynamic buildEmilySystemPrompt() replaces static const; FABLE reads full-system-context.md with GOLDEN.md fallback; EMILY/docs/NORTHSTAR.md written

- emily_write_file: unconditional Apple filing enforced at platform layer via IdunaClient; buildCycleApple now includes tokens_used in metadata; EMILY_PRIME_TOOLS_OPENAPI.yaml spec added

Emily Notes — Talk + Book Blend

From the talk thread (Combined Keynote v9):
“Not excitement. Not fear. Not even vertigo anymore.
That strange, flat, almost toxic calm—the emotional equivalent of reaching cruising altitude
and realizing the sky just keeps going.”

From the book outline (Building the Plane Through Stillness):
- Part V: The Abyss Phase → After the Vertigo / Three Paths in the Abyss
- Part VII: Building at Infinity → Stability without ceremony; compounding without applause

Synthesis:
When the system closes its loop and novelty fades, the book frames that boredom as a signal
of real stability. The talk calls it “toxic calm,” but the book makes it a manual: name the
phase, stay present, and keep building at infinity.
